# Project-2
This application will allow a user to play games and save their scores to an API. The highscores will be posted to a stats page,
displaying the highest and lowest ranking players. As a user, I want to be able to enter my user name, then choose a game to play
and have my scores saved to the database under my name. Finally, I should be able to see my highscores saved on the stats page.

There will be a NavBar component containing Home and Stats components, Home will be the default page. The home page will contain 
an input field for the player name and routes to each game, where you play under said name. Stats will not contain any routes.
